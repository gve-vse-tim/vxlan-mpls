Using CSR1000v as a BorderPE to "stitch" MPLS VPNv4 to VXLAN EVPN

# Acknowledgments
Much of the VXLAN EVPN Nexus configurations were inspired/taken from Matt 
Tarkington's repository (https://github.com/mtarking/cisco-programmable-fabric).  

As this repository evolves, it will look less and less like the original as 
I refactor the codes and break out the modules for training purposes as well
as clarity of function.

But, I heavily used Matt's repo to train myself on Ansible on Nexus and want
to acknowledge its role.
